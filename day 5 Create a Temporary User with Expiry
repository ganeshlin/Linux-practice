# Linux Task 5 – Create Temporary User with Expiry (Nautilus Project)

## 📌 Task Overview

As part of the Nautilus project in the Stratos Datacenter, a temporary user account is required for a developer who needs access only for a limited time.

### ✅ Requirements

* Create a user named **`john`** (lowercase only)
* Perform the task **only on App Server 3**
* Set the account **expiry date to 2024-02-17**
* Follow standard Linux user management practices

---

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1️⃣ Connect to App Server 3

From the Jump Host, SSH into App Server 3:

```bash
ssh stapp03
```

---

### 2️⃣ Switch to Root User

User creation requires administrative privileges:

```bash
sudo -i
```

---

### 3️⃣ Create the User with Expiry Date

Use the `useradd` command with the `-e` option:

```bash
useradd -e 2024-02-17 john
```

#### 🔍 Command Explanation

* `useradd` → Creates a new user account
* `-e 2024-02-17` → Sets the account expiry date
* `john` → Username (lowercase as required)

---

### 4️⃣ Verify User Creation

Check whether the user exists:

```bash
id john
```

✅ This confirms the user was created successfully.

---

### 5️⃣ Verify Account Expiry Date

Confirm the expiry date using:

```bash
chage -l john
```

✅ Expected output:

```
Account expires : Feb 17, 2024
```

## ✔ Validation Checklist

* [x] User created only on **App Server 3**
* [x] Username follows lowercase standard
* [x] Expiry date correctly set
* [x] Verified using `id` and `chage`

---

## 🌍 Real-World Use Case

Temporary user accounts are widely used for:

* Contractors and interns
* Short-term project collaborators
* Audited or compliance-based access

Setting an expiry date helps:

* Automatically revoke access
* Improve system security
* Prevent stale user accounts

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

This task demonstrates how Linux supports **time-bound access control**, a critical skill for system administrators and DevOps engineers managing secure environments.
