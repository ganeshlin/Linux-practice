## Day 4 – Create Service User Without Home Directory

### Task
Create a service user `anita` on App Server 3 without a home directory.

### Commands Used
```bash
ssh tony@stapp03
sudo useradd -M anita
id anita
ls /home
Verification

User anita exists

/home/anita does not exist

Task Requirement (Simple)

Create a service user:

Username: anita

Server: App Server 3

Home directory: ❌ Do NOT create

🔹 Step-by-Step Solution
1️⃣ Login to App Server 3

From the jump server (or wherever SSH access is allowed):

ssh tony@stapp03


👉 Use the provided password when prompted.

2️⃣ Create user anita without home directory

Use the -M option (means no home directory):

sudo useradd -M anita


✅ This creates the user without /home/anita.

3️⃣ Verify the user exists
id anita


Expected output (example):

uid=1003(anita) gid=1003(anita) groups=1003(anita)

4️⃣ Confirm NO home directory was created
ls /home


👉 You should NOT see anita listed.

Or check directly:

ls -ld /home/anita


Expected output:

ls: cannot access '/home/anita': No such file or directory


✅ This confirms the requirement is met.
Why this task is important (Real World Use)

Service users are used by applications, not humans

They don’t need home directories

Improves security and system cleanliness

Common for:

Monitoring agents

Backup services

Application daemons
