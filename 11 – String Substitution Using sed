Task Overview

Within the Stratos Datacenter, the Nautilus backup server stores template XML files required by the Nautilus application.
Before these templates can be used, placeholder strings must be replaced with valid data.

As part of routine maintenance, system administrators at xFusionCorp Industries use Linux string and file manipulation utilities to update such files efficiently.

🎯 Objective

Replace all occurrences of the string:

String → Marine


in the XML file located at:

/root/nautilus.xml


on the backup server.
🖥️ Server Details
Component	Value
Server Role	Backup Server
File Type	XML
File Path	/root/nautilus.xml
Tool Used	sed

🛠️ Solution Steps
1️⃣ Log in to the Backup Server
ssh root@backup-server

2️⃣ Create a Backup of the Original File (Best Practice)
cp /root/nautilus.xml /root/nautilus.xml.bak


📌 This ensures recovery is possible if a rollback is required.
3️⃣ Replace All Occurrences Using sed
sed -i 's/String/Marine/g' /root/nautilus.xml

Command Explanation:

sed → Stream editor for text manipulation

-i → Edit the file in place

s/String/Marine/g → Substitute all occurrences globally

/root/nautilus.xml → Target file
4️⃣ Verify the Changes
Confirm replacement:
grep -n "Marine" /root/nautilus.xml

Ensure old string is removed:
grep -n "String" /root/nautilus.xml


✔️ No output confirms successful replacement

✅ Result

All instances of String have been replaced with Marine

XML template is updated and ready for application use
