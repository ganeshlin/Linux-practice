# 🔐 Disable Direct Root SSH Login on App Servers

## 📌 Task Overview

Following recent security audits, **xFusionCorp Industries** enforced new security protocols to restrict **direct root SSH access**. The objective of this task is to **disable direct SSH login for the root user** on all **Application Servers** in the **Stratos Datacenter**.

This task aligns with industry best practices and is commonly validated in **Nautilus / KodeKloud-style labs**.

---

## 🏗️ Environment Details

* **Datacenter:** Stratos
* **Servers:**

  * `stapp01`
  * `stapp02`
  * `stapp03`
* **Service:** OpenSSH (`sshd`)

---

## 🎯 Objective

* Prevent users from logging in directly as `root` via SSH
* Enforce access through standard users with `sudo` privileges
* Improve security, auditing, and compliance

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation

### 🔹 Step 1: SSH into the App Server

From the **Jump Host**, connect using a non-root user:

```bash
ssh tony@stapp01
```

Repeat this step for all app servers.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Switch to Root User

```bash
sudo su -
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Edit SSH Configuration

Open the SSH daemon configuration file:

```bash
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Disable Root Login

Search for the following directive:

```bash
/PermitRootLogin
```

Update or add the setting as shown below:

```ini
PermitRootLogin no
```

⚠️ **Important Notes:**

* Uncomment the line if it starts with `#`
* Ensure there is **only one** `PermitRootLogin` entry

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Restart SSH Service

Apply the configuration changes:

```bash
systemctl restart sshd
```

Verify the service status:

```bash
systemctl status sshd
```

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Validation Test

From the jump host, attempt to log in as root:

```bash
ssh root@stapp01
```

✅ **Expected Result:**

```text
Permission denied, please try again.
```

This confirms that root SSH login is disabled.

---

## 🔁 Repeat for All App Servers

Perform the above steps on:

* `stapp01`
* `stapp02`
* `stapp03`

---

## ✅ Final Result

* 🔒 Root SSH login disabled on all app servers
* 👤 Access enforced via standard users + sudo
* 📊 Improved audit trail and accountability
* 🛡️ Reduced attack surface

---

## 🌍 Real-World Use Case

In production environments:

* Direct root login is a **major security risk**
* Disabling it prevents brute-force attacks
* Enables user-level logging and accountability
* Meets compliance standards like **CIS Benchmarks**

---

## 🧠 Key Learning

> *Security is not just about access — it’s about controlled, auditable access.*

This task demonstrates a foundational Linux hardening step used across enterprise systems.
