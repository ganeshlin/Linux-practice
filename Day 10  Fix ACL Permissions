# Linux Task 10 – Fix ACL Permissions on /etc/hosts

## 📌 Task Overview
After a security audit in the **Stratos Datacenter**, the Nautilus security team identified misconfigured permissions on a critical system file.

**File:** `/etc/hosts`  
**Server:** Nautilus App 1 (`stapp01`)

The production support team was asked to correct ownership, permissions, and ACLs.

---

## 🎯 Requirements
1. File owner must be `root`
2. File group must be `root`
3. Others should have **read-only** permission
4. User `yousuf` must have **no permissions**
5. User `jerome` must have **read-only** permission

---

## 🖥️ Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Login to App Server
```bash
ssh tony@stapp01
sudo -i

Step 2: Set Owner and Group to root
chown root:root /etc/hosts


Reason: Ensures ownership compliance with security standards.

Step 3: Set Others Permission to Read-Only
chmod o=r /etc/hosts
Reason: Prevents unauthorized modification by other users.

Step 4: Clear Existing ACLs (Safe Baseline)
setfacl -b /etc/hosts


Reason: Removes any previous ACL entries that may conflict.

Step 5: Deny All Permissions for User yousuf
setfacl -m u:yousuf:0 /etc/hosts
Reason: Explicitly blocks access using ACLs.

Step 6: Grant Read-Only Permission to User jerome
setfacl -m u:jerome:r /etc/hosts


Reason: Allows controlled access without changing global permissions.

🔍 Verification
Check File Permissions
ls -l /etc/hosts
Expected output:

text
Copy code
-rw-r--r--+ 1 root root 374 Jan  3 14:19 /etc/hosts
+ indicates ACLs are applied
Check ACL Configuration
getfacl /etc/hosts


Expected output:
# file: etc/hosts
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rw-
user:jerome:r--
user:yousuf:---
group::r--
mask::r--
other::r--
Key Learnings

chmod controls generic permissions

setfacl is required for user-specific access control

ACL mask plays a critical role in effective permissions
